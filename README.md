This is a simple matlab script, written by Stefan Haessler of [Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquée (LOA), CNRS, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France](https://loa.ensta-paris.fr/research/pco-research-group/). It that solves the 1D nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a Kerr-nonlinearity and dispersion with a split-step method.

This simulates femtosecond laser pulse propagation in a medium, in particular in conditions that are typically used for hollow-core fiber post-compression.

This script has been used for the illustrations and animation in the [lecture on laser post-compression](https://ilm.univ-lyon1.fr/images/ILM/Equipe_05/Femto_UP/Stefan_HAESSLER_FemtoUP_2017.mp4) that Stefan gave in 2017 at the CNRS "Ecole Th\'ematique" Femto-UP.
